# Vibe Town Development Progress

## March 16, 2025

### Initial Setup
- Created architecture.md documenting the overall system design
- Created implementationplanv0.md with detailed development steps
- Created WORKSPACE_RULES.md with coding guidelines
- Organized all documentation in /memory-bank directory
- Added progress tracking requirement to WORKSPACE_RULES.md to ensure consistent documentation

### Git Setup
- Initialized Git repository
- Created comprehensive .gitignore file to exclude:
  * Dependencies (node_modules)
  * Build outputs (dist)
  * Environment files (.env)
  * IDE files
  * OS-specific files
  * Logs
- Made initial commit with all documentation

### Project Decisions
- Decided to start with single room implementation (no lobby system)
- Will focus on core functionality first (movement, basic voice chat)
- Designed for future scaling to hundreds of thousands of users
- Keeping player customization minimal for V0

### Project Setup (March 16, 2025)
- Created Vite + React + TypeScript project structure manually
- Set up modular folder structure following architectural principles:
  * src/components/ for React UI components
  * src/scenes/ for Phaser game scenes
  * src/utils/ for shared utility functions
  * src/assets/ for game assets
  * server/ for Colyseus server implementation
- Created core configuration files:
  * package.json with all dependencies
  * tsconfig.json with proper module paths
  * vite.config.ts with aliases
  * ESLint configuration
- Implemented React components:
  * App.tsx as the main container
  * Game.tsx as the Phaser integration point
  * ChatIndicator.tsx for voice chat UI
- Created Phaser implementation:
  * MainScene.ts for game world and player movement
- Set up Colyseus server:
  * Server configuration with CORS
  * VibeTownRoom implementation
  * Player schema with position and speaking status
- Implemented voice chat utility using PeerJS
- Created comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
- Installed dependencies:
  * Phaser for game engine
  * PeerJS for WebRTC voice chat
  * Colyseus for multiplayer server
  * Express and CORS for server setup

### Next Steps
- Create a simple tilemap for the game world using Tiled Map Editor (50x50 tiles, 32x32 pixel size)
- Implement basic tests for critical functionality using Vitest
- Run the application and verify core functionality
- Implement player movement and collision detection

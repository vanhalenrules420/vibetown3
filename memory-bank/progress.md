# Vibe Town Development Progress

## March 16, 2025

### Initial Setup
- Created architecture.md documenting the overall system design
- Created implementationplanv0.md with detailed development steps
- Created WORKSPACE_RULES.md with coding guidelines
- Organized all documentation in /memory-bank directory
- Added progress tracking requirement to WORKSPACE_RULES.md to ensure consistent documentation

### Project Decisions
- Decided to start with single room implementation (no lobby system)
- Will focus on core functionality first (movement, basic voice chat)
- Designed for future scaling to hundreds of thousands of users
- Keeping player customization minimal for V0

### Next Steps
- Initialize Vite project with React and TypeScript
- Set up project structure
- Install core dependencies (Colyseus, PeerJS, Phaser)
